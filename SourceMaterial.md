The primary source for the initial version was the Portol thesaurus. This was refined to form a more ontological structure.

We collected the information from:

**http://www.portol.org/thesaurus/ThesaurusSearchResults.php?searchstr=**

And arranged it into a hierarchy using Protege4

Information was also collected from Wikipedia and invertebrate zoology textbooks

The ontology is currently being evaluated and edited by Porifera biologists
