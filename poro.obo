While all animals have unspecialized cells that can transform into specialized cells, sponges are unique in having some specialized cells that can transform into other types, often migrating between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes, and the shapes of their bodies are adapted to maximize the efficiency of the water flow. All are sessile aquatic animals and, although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding 8,800 metres (5.5 mi)" [Wikipedia:Sponge]

name: choanocyte
def: "A cell that lines the interior of Asconoid, syconoid and leuconoid body type sponges that contain a central flagellum surrounded by a collar of microvilli which are connected by a thin membrane. The choanocyte is ovoid, with one end adjacent to the mesohyl (in some species). It is the closest family member to the free-living ancestor called choanoflagellate. The flagellae beat regularly, creating a water flow across the microvilli which can then filter nutrients and other food from the water taken from the collar of the sponge. Food particles are then phagocytosed by the cell. Choanocytes are found dotting the surface of the spongocoel in asconoid sponges and the radial canals in syconoid sponges, but they comprise entirely the chambers in leuconoid sponges. By cooperatively moving their flagella, choanocytes generate a flow of water through the sponges pores, into the spongocoel, and out through the osculum. This improves both respiratory and digestive functions for the sponge, pulling in oxygen and nutrients and allowing a rapid expulsion of carbon dioxide and other waste products. Although all cells in a sponge are capable of living on their own, choanocytes carry out most of the sponge's ingestion, passing digested materials to the amoebocytes for delivery to other cells." [ISBN:0030229073, Wikipedia:Choanocyte]
comment: They bear more than a passing resemblance to Choanoflagellates, and demonstrate key steps in the evolution of animals. Scientist Nicole King helped to establish the distinction.[1] DNA sequencing indicates that multicellular choanoflagellates and poriferans are sister groups, both descended from the same eukaryotic clade. One can see modern choanoflagellates living in small colonies, illustrating the evolution of sponges by analogy. More complex animals, notably the cnidarians, possess cells whose structures are clearly derived from choanocytes, demonstrating their historical ties to phylum porifera.

The asconoid body plan is characterized by a stalk-like spongocoel surrounded by a single layer of choanocytes. These choanocytes are cells that have flagella, and the flagella beat to push water through the spongocoel, creating a current. At somewhat regular intervals along the lining of the spongocoel are openings called ostia (singular, ostium). These protrude through the outer layer of the sponge (somewhat like an epidermis, but not entirely like it, since this terminology implies germ layers, which sponges do not have). Finally, at the top of the sponge is the osculum, which is the final exit for water circulating through the sponge. This single layer of choanocytes limits the size of asconoids, with the largest having a diameter of only 1 mm. This is due to the surface area : mass ratio which would not allow an asconoid sponge of larger size sufficient nutrition." [Wikipedia:Asconoid]
